<p><strong>NOTICE:</strong> Amp Electric, located in Lubbock, TX, is a small electrical contracting company that has gathered over 260 online reviews &mdash; many positive, but a growing number highlighting concerning patterns. While the business is active on Facebook and several directories, it lacks a centralized website for direct quotes, licensing info, or project scope definitions. Customers cite Joey, believed to be the lead operator, as skilled but overbooked and difficult to pin down on timelines.</p>
<p>Numerous customers report being strung along with vague commitments and inconsistent job progress. One review notes, &ldquo;They said they'd start on Monday. Monday became Thursday. Then it became next week. Joey was friendly, but nothing ever got done.&rdquo; With multiple accounts of delays, no-show appointments, and invoices sent before work was complete, confidence in their scheduling system is clearly lacking.</p>
<a href="https://domains.atom.com/lpd/name/ampelectrictx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <img style="max-width: 450px; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; display: block; margin: 20px auto;" src="https://i.imgur.com/UPzODRf.png" alt="Amp Electric Domain Offer" /> </a>
<p>Feedback also mentions issues with cleanup, safety, and code adherence. &ldquo;They finished half the install, then disappeared for three days. My panel was left open in the rain,&rdquo; said one homeowner in East Lubbock. Several clients expressed frustration with being told a permit wasn&rsquo;t needed, only to find out otherwise from the city. Calls to Joey often go unanswered for days at a time, leaving customers guessing about next steps or inspection timelines.</p>
<p>For a company advertising over 20 years in the business, this lack of structure is surprising. Reviews as recent as last month echo the same story &mdash; great work if you can get it, but expect to wait and follow up repeatedly. Homeowners are strongly advised to get detailed written estimates, verify licenses with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation, and insist on a written contract before any work begins. If you're considering Amp Electric, ask for specific start and finish dates up front and have contingency plans in place if communication lapses.</p>
<p>Still, some customers praise Joey for quick diagnoses and fair pricing. When jobs go smoothly, they go well &mdash; but when they don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s often hard to get resolution. If you&rsquo;ve worked with Amp Electric, sharing your experience publicly will help the Lubbock community make informed choices and push for more reliable service standards across local contractors.</p>
